Subject: Embarking on a Journey of DSA Exploration ðŸš€

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well! I'm excited to share that we are diving into the fascinating world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). In this learning endeavor, we are setting up a structured system to make our exploration effective and organized.

Here's a breakdown of what we're going to do:

1. **Concept Section:**
   - This folder will be dedicated to fundamental concepts of DSA.
   - Sub-folders will focus on individual data structures and algorithms.

2. **DSA Questions:**
   - Prepare to challenge yourself with a dedicated section for practicing DSA questions.
   - Sub-folders will be categorized by difficulty level or specific topics.

3. **Company-wise Questions:**
   - A specialized section for questions asked by specific companies.
   - Sub-folders will be organized based on the company name.

4. **Miscellaneous Section:**
   - Here, we'll cover additional topics related to DSA that don't fit into the above categories.

5. **Specific Formulas Section:**
   - This is the place to go for quick reference to important formulas related to DSA.

As we embark on this learning journey, I encourage you to dive deep into each section and actively participate in discussions. Feel free to share insights, ask questions, and contribute to the collective learning experience.

Remember, the more we engage, the more we learn. Let's make this journey not only informative but also enjoyable.

Looking forward to our shared exploration of the vast realm of Data Structures and Algorithms!

To solve this problem, we'll apply a translation transformation to move the center of the circle by the given distances without changing its radius. Here's how we do it:

Given:
- Radius of the circle (r) = 10
- Center coordinates of the circle (x_c, y_c) = (1, 4)
- Translation distances: 5 units towards the X-axis and 1 unit towards the Y-axis

Translation transformation matrix:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \text{dx} \\
0 & 1 & \text{dy} \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Where dx is the translation distance along the X-axis and dy is the translation distance along the Y-axis.

Applying the translation:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 5 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_c \\
y_c \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, let's apply this transformation to the center coordinates (1, 4) of the circle:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 5 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
4 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 + 5 \\
4 + 1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
6 \\
5 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

So, the new center coordinates of the circle after applying the translation are (6, 5). The radius remains unchanged. Therefore, the new circle has a center at (6, 5) and a radius of 10.
