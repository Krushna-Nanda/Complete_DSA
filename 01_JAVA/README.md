substring(): Returns a new string that is a substring of the string.
replace(): Replaces each substring of the string that matches the literal target sequence with the specified literal replacement sequence.
equals(): Compares this string to the specified object.
equalsIgnoreCase(): Compares this String to another String, ignoring case considerations.
contains(): Returns true if and only if this string contains the specified sequence of char values.
startsWith(): Tests if this string starts with the specified prefix.
endsWith(): Tests if this string ends with the specified suffix.
charAt(): Returns the char value at the specified index.
split(): Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.
join(): Joins the elements of the provided elements into a single String.
format(): Returns a formatted string using the specified format string and arguments.
valueOf(): Returns the string representation of the Object argument.
compareTo(): Compares two strings lexicographically.
compareToIgnoreCase(): Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case differences.
isEmpty(): Returns true if, and only if, length() is 0.
lastIndexOf(): Returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of the specified character.
concat(): Concatenates the specified string to the end of this string.
intern(): Returns a canonical representation for the string object.
repeat(): Returns a string whose value is the concatenation of this string repeated count times.
strip(), stripLeading(), stripTrailing(): Remove leading and/or trailing whitespace from a string.
isBlank(): Returns true if the string is empty or contains only white space codepoints, otherwise false.
lines(): Returns a stream of lines extracted from this string, separated by line terminators.
matches(): Tells whether or not this string matches the given regular expression.
offsetByCodePoints(): Returns the index within this String that is offset from the given index by codePointOffset code points.
codePointAt(), codePointBefore(), codePointCount(): Methods to deal with Unicode code points.
getBytes(): Encodes this String into a sequence of bytes using the platform s default charset, storing the result into a new byte array.
getChars(): Copies characters from this string into the destination character array.
contentEquals(): Compares this string to the specified CharSequence.
copyValueOf(): Returns a String that represents the characters of the character array.
hashCode(): Returns a hash code for this string.
toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(): Converts all of the characters in this String to lower case or upper case.
toString(): This object (which is already a string!) is itself returned.
wait(), notify(), notifyAll(): Standard methods from the Object class for inter-thread communication.
getClass(), clone(), finalize(), registerNatives(): Other methods from the Object class.
Please note that some methods like wait(), notify(), notifyAll(), getClass(), clone(), finalize(), registerNatives() are inherited from the Object class and are not specific to the String class.
